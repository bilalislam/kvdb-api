### `docker compose for local build`

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about all the features of Compose, [see the list of features ](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#features)

A docker-compose.yml looks like:

```docker

version: '3'

services:
  api:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: tools/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

```

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.
